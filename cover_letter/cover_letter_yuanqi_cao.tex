  %% THIS IS FOR http://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=fb0b5f8bb543f402&from=myjobs&tk=19uqcfjls82oqccs
  I am writing to apply for the work position of graduate software engineer in Raytheon. I was graduate from UNSW and got enough knowledge for this job. I got a solid knowledge of Java, J2EE, OO design and linux shell, I hope I could get a chance for this position.

  I am very familiar with Java and its J2EE frameworks I could code in some popular Java frameworks such as Spring, hibernate and Play. I am still responsible for a commercial website project's backend coding with Spring, Spring MVC and Shiro. I also got some useful design pattern, UML map, C and C++ knowledge as well. I think these could be very useful for this work position.

  I could work with command-line without any trouble, My working environment is OS X and I am a advanced linux user (3 years). I am also an advanced Emacs user and manage my setting file on Github. I could code in some popular script such as Python, Perl, Shell. I got some knowledge of Lisp and {\LaTeX}  as well even that is not so popular. There are some script I wrote in my Github repository, if you like you could check that. I think that is another advantage.

  Before I become a programmer I also get experience in biology filed and insurance industry (for 2 years).  These experience make me learn skills very quickly and actively. I think I could  get involved in new environment and new job as well as soon as possible.

  This is good opportunity for me and I am looking forward to hearing from you and get an opportunity of interview.
